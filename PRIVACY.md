## Overview

WitNote ("the Application") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the Application handles your data.

## Data Collection

**WitNote collects NO user data whatsoever.**

The Application is designed with privacy at its core:
- ✅ **100% Local Processing** - All AI processing occurs entirely on your device

- ✅ **No Third-Party Services** - The Application does not integrate with any third-party services

## How Your Data is Handled

### Your Notes
- All notes are stored locally on your device in a folder you choose
- The Application never uploads your notes to any server
- You have complete control over your note files

### AI Processing
- The Application uses Ollama, a local AI engine that runs entirely on your device
- All AI processing happens offline on your computer
- Your conversations with the AI never leave your device

### File Access
- The Application only accesses files in the folder you explicitly select
- The Application uses macOS/Windows security bookmarks to persist access permissions
- You can revoke access at any time by removing the Application or changing folder permissions

## Data Security

Since all data remains on your device:
- Your data is protected by your device's security mechanisms
- No data transmission means no interception risk
- You control backups through your standard file backup procedures

## Third-Party Access

The Application does NOT share any data with third parties because:
- No data is collected
- No data leaves your device
- No network connections are made

## Children's Privacy

The Application is safe for all ages as it collects no personal information whatsoever.
